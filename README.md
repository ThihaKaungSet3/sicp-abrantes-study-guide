# My personal study guide for SICP

## 1 What is this GitHub repository?

This is my attempt to systematize my study of one of the best computer science
books of all time (some say "the best"), the **[Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs (SICP)](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)**,
written by Hal Abelson, Jerry Sussman and Julie Sussman.

This book was created for the mythical [6.001 Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) discipline](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/index.htm), which for 27 years (1980 to 2007) was considered the highest-level
programming discipline in existence. More than [100 universities around the world
have adopted this book](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/adopt-list.html).

In fact, from the point of view of MIT teachers, you could not be considered a "true"
computer scientist if you did not understand the content discussed in the SICP. Some
quotes to support that vision:

> I've only ever seen one great book on the subject of computer programming: Structure
and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Abelson and Sussman; MIT Press). If you're
already a great programmer, it will take you an evening to read the first few chapters
and you'll discover a precision vocabulary for discussing what you've spent 10 years
learning the hard way. If you're not already a great programmer, I would have thought
that these few chapters would save you from having to spend years flailing around in
the dark.
> - [Philip Greenspun (The Bookshelf of a well-read Web Nerd)](http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/bookshelf.html)

> MIT set the bar very high for these courses, creating a required course (6.001)
and a textbook (Abelson & Sussmanâ€™s Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)
which were used at dozens or even hundreds of top CS schools as the de facto introduction
to computer science. (You can, and should, watch an older version of the lectures online.)
> - [Joel Spolsky (The Perils of JavaSchools)](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/12/29/the-perils-of-javaschools-2/)

> The book should be read by every self-respecting computer scientist. Because of its
clarity, simplicity, and wit, this work is highly recommended to anyone seeking an
understanding of the emerging paradigms of computer science.
> - Mitchell Wand (American Scientist)

> Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) is one of the true programming
classics. It's a well-deserved position; SICP is simply the best programming book I've ever
read. I made my first pass through it a year ago but deliberately postponed my review;
reading SICP completely changed the way I approach programming. [...] SICP is one of the
most important books in our field.
> - [Adam Tornhill (SICP Book Review)](https://www.adamtornhill.com/reviews/sicp.htm)

> The book should be obligatory for anyone involved in teaching computer science at
degree level: it will convince them that inside computer science there really is a true
science trying to get out.
> - David Barron (The Times Higher Education Supplement)

Although there are also [criticisms of the SICP](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fffk-htdp-vs-sicp-journal/),
many programmers are now returning to study it and saying that it has not yet been overcome
([What I Have (Re)-learned From SICP](https://code-and-cocktails.herokuapp.com/blog/2014/07/06/what-i-have-re-learned-from-sicp/)).

A quick Google search for "sicp study guide" will show dozens and more dozens of recent
reports from individual SICP studies, even if MIT itself is [no longer offering this
discipline in its new curriculum](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the_end_of_an_era_1/).

This GitHub repository is my individual study guide for SICP. I'm starting now in, February
2019, and I intend to finish within 1 year. Feel free to use the materials and codes I will
put here and send me suggestions and criticisms (abrantesasf at gmail dot com).

Have a nice SICP!




## 2 Initial difficulty: how to study?

The main difficulty I had, before starting, was to define a method, a plan for
the study that used the resources available on the internet beyond the book itself.

I spent almost 2 months looking for material on the internet and establishing a
plan that could be followed by me in my free time. What I have established:

1. **Get the SICP Book!** The entire original text of the SICP is available under a Creative
   Commons license for online reading in
   [http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html).
   * There are other versions on internet:
     * A beautifull [HTML5 version](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/), created by Andres Raba;
     * A beutifull [PDF version](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf/raw/master/sicp.pdf), created by Andres Raba; and
     * An online [Interactive version](https://xuanji.appspot.com/isicp/index.html), created by Li Xuanji.
   * And, of course, there are the printed versions:
     * SICP on: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering-dp-0262011530/dp/0262011530), [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs-second-edition)
     * Instructor's Manual to SICP on: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Instructors-Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs/dp/0262692201/), [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/instructors-manual-ta-structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs-second-edition)
