# My personal study guide for SICP

This is my attempt to systematize my study of one of the best computer science
books of all time (some say "the best"), the **[Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs (SICP)!](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)**,
written by Hal Abelson, Jerry Sussman and Julie Sussman.

This book was created for the mythical [6.001 Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) discipline!](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/index.htm), which for 27 years (1980 to 2007) was considered the highest-level
programming discipline in existence. More than [100 universities around the world
have adopted this book!](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/adopt-list.html).

In fact, from the point of view of MIT teachers, you could not be considered a "true"
computer scientist if you did not understand the content discussed in the SICP.
