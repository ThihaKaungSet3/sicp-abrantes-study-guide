# My personal study guide for SICP

This is my attempt to systematize my study of one of the best computer science
books of all time (some say "the best"), the **Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs (SICP)**, written by Hal Abelson, Jerry Sussman and Julie
Sussman.

This book was created for the mythical 6.001 Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) discipline, which for 27 years (1980 to 2007) was considered the highest-level
programming discipline in existence. More than 100 universities around the world
have adopted this book.

In fact, from the point of view of MIT teachers, you could not be considered a "true"
computer scientist if you did not understand the content discussed in the SICP.
