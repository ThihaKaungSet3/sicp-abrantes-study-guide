# My personal study guide for SICP

This is my attempt to systematize my study of one of the best computer science
books of all time (some say "the best"), the **[Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs (SICP)](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)**,
written by Hal Abelson, Jerry Sussman and Julie Sussman.

This book was created for the mythical [6.001 Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) discipline](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/index.htm), which for 27 years (1980 to 2007) was considered the highest-level
programming discipline in existence. More than [100 universities around the world
have adopted this book](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/adopt-list.html).

In fact, from the point of view of MIT teachers, you could not be considered a "true"
computer scientist if you did not understand the content discussed in the SICP. Some
quotes to support that vision:

> I've only ever seen one great book on the subject of computer programming: Structure
and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Abelson and Sussman; MIT Press). If you're
already a great programmer, it will take you an evening to read the first few chapters
and you'll discover a precision vocabulary for discussing what you've spent 10 years
learning the hard way. If you're not already a great programmer, I would have thought
that these few chapters would save you from having to spend years flailing around in
the dark.
> [Philip Greenspun (The Bookshelf of a well-read Web Nerd)](http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/bookshelf.html)

> MIT set the bar very high for these courses, creating a required course (6.001)
and a textbook (Abelson & Sussmanâ€™s Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)
which were used at dozens or even hundreds of top CS schools as the de facto introduction
to computer science. (You can, and should, watch an older version of the lectures online.)
